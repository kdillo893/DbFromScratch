# DbFromScratch
Create database following online tutorials to learn how they work

the one i'm following is here https://build-your-own.org/database/
another one for C is here https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/

I want to eventually learn Go, but I also need to practice C...

## Build & Run
I'm unfamiliar with Go, but this is what I understand so far.

Build the module with the following:
```
go mod tidy
```
`go.mod` should grab what's needed.

Run after the build like this:
```
go run dbmain.go
```
